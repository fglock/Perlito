pX/Common/iterator_engine_TALK - fglock

This is a sketch for a talk, to be presented on YAPC::Brasil::2006 in april
or YAPC::SouthAmerica::2006 in september.
(work in progress - write comments like this - comments welcome! - fglock)

(todo - ask in the Brasil-PM list if they want a p6 intro or a technical talk)

(todo - keep this short - 20min talk - or is it 40?)

(todo? - talk about infinite lists and how I got into the Pugs project; 
say something about previous Perl 5 projects Set::Infinite, DateTime, Inline::Parrot)

- Title --?

- Perl 6 intro
-- (reuse some text - not technical)

- Synopsis are not 'compiler specifications'
(specifications may be the wrong word - check this - see audreyt blog on perl6doc)
(general idea - there is room for multiple implementations, since the specification is general enough)
-- synopsis describe the behaviour of the language
-- specifications describe the specific implementations
-- the documentation is in CPAN - Perl6::Bible 
(what is the name of perl6doc?)

- Pugs
(keep this short - there is too much to talk here)
-- Pugs the language implementation
--- Featherweight Perl 6
--- Haskell
-- Pugs the project
--- Anarchyst place (check Audreyt talks)
--- Multiple Backends
--- Multiple Implementations
--- Many Experiments
-- Parrot
--- Traditional Project
--- Some people joining Pugs - better projects integration

- P6 on P5
-- Early experiments
--- Perl6::* in CPAN
(check history)
-- pilRun
--- an emitter and library
-- Piln
--- low level (bytecode) Perl 5
(how is this going on - what are the current ideas)
-- pX
--- (write about putter's goals)
--- Iterator engine

- Iterator engine
-- backtracking implemented using an infinite list of match states?
(rephrase this in a simple way people can undesrtand, or remove it)
--- backtracking primitives implemented in 100 lines of Perl 5
--- higher-order functions
----- other ops were implemented reusing the primitives 
----- very short program, single point of failure ( = testable)
----- not really slow

- Rules
-- very easy to implement - the primitives hide _all_ the backtracking complexity
-- base rule grammar implemented in 100 lines of code
-- after implementing basic rules, new rules can be compiles using... rules!
-- many tests - rules are _too_ important in this implementation

- Perl 6 grammar
-- Perl 6 was meant to be specified using it's own Grammar syntax
-- 'Grammar' only takes 10 lines of code!
-- TimToady and audreyt introduce a way to build AST from inside the Grammar - just in the right time!
-- Text::Balanced implements the slow parts - so I don't have to care with performance right now

(this is the main part of the talk - take some time here)
  source text => (example)
  Grammar that matched the text => (example)
  compiled Grammar => (show)
  Grammar generates AST => (example)
  emitter generates code => (example)

- Current work
(this will change until april - move done things to new sections)
- How can it change the syntax before the grammar compilation is finished?
(example - define the 'sub' keyword and then declare a 'sub')
-- Parse-compile cycle needs more integration - TODO!
--- something to do with BEGIN and CHECK blocks - find out

(the talk may end here, depends on what will be done until there)

- Implementing Perl 6

- Syntax tables
-- statements
-- functions

- Operator precedence and fixity

- Prelude
-- part of the library that is implemented using Perl 6
--- near 100% !
    sub infix:<+> { eval(' $_[0] + $_[1] ', :lang<perl5>); }

- Plan
-- execute Pugs tests
-- optimize
- p6compiler written in p6
