"Perlito" Perl compiler

    This is Perlito, a compiler collection that implements a subset of Perl 5 and Perl 6.

Backends

    Perlito can compile Perl 5 or Perl 6 programs into one of the 'backend'
    languages:

        Perl 5 to Perl 5
        Perl 5 to Javascript

        Perl 6 to Perl 5
        Perl 6 to Javascript
        Perl 6 to Python 2.6

    The following compilers are work in progress - some tests pass, some tests fail:

        Perl 5 to Perl 6
        Perl 6 to Ruby 1.9

    Perlito 6.0 (2010-07-27) also compile to additional backends.
    Check the Changelog file for details:

        Perl 6 to Go
        Perl 6 to Common Lisp (SBCL)
        Perl 6 to Ruby 1.9
